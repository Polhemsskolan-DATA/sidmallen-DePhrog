    <p class="CritsInfo">Random crits, more known as one form of citical hits the others being "critical hits and mini crit" even tough random crits aren't totaly random as when you have done a curtain amount of damage in a short period of time your chances of getting a critical hit goes from the normal 2% chanse to capping of at 800dmg giving you a 10% chance of dealing 3x the normal amount of damage. It is like a reward for doing good but my sulotion to this problem is that random crits shouldnt be removed just reworked to the opposite i feel like when you are preforming good you don't need a random crit to appear to just delete someone. But if you have been steamrolled for the entire game i feel like you should have a higher chance of getting a random crit seeing it as taking even a single player out from the enemy team can be enough for your team to regain balance and therefore work as such, your wepon should have a 10% chance of hitting a critical hit if you are going downhill but decrease the chance of a random crit the better you perform. keep in mind as stated before in a "short amount of time" is 20 seconds then it resets or keeps the prior damage dealt during the last 20 seconds and that if you feel like random crits are bs you there are servers you can join that have setting such as turning of random crits.</p>
